# Evaluation

## General evaluation of the implementation and comparison with the paper

- EXP-01 Comparison of Waypoints and HLL as Indicators of State Space Coverage
- EXP-02 Maximum Size Hash Table
- EXP-03 Multiple VTs Sharing a Kernel
- EXP-04 Improving State Space Coverage Growth using Start Overs

## Low-Connectivity model evaluation

- EXP-10 Comparison of Exploration of the Dining Philosophers Problem with Different Number of Processes
- EXP-11 Comparing Models by their BFS Frontiers: Relative and Absolute
- EXP-12 Comparing Models by Percentage of VTs Finding a Violation, Unique States Visited, Total States Visited, and State Space Coverage
- EXP-13 Comparing the Start Over Strategy on Low-Connectivity Models

### TODO

- EXP-14 Exploring DP/Anderson/Peterson using Depth-limited process-PDS
