    "# Protocol: Multiple VTs Sharing a Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 16.09.2021\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it make a difference whether VTs are executed sequentially with only one per kernel, or parallel as blocks of a kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Both variants yield the same results. The parallel execution should have better performance, as only one kernel setup is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n",
    "- Program: `main` branch, commit e160572\n",
    "- Model: Waypoints model\n",
    "- CUDA_FLAGS: `-DGRAPPLE_MODEL=WaypointsState`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we compile with the additional CUDA_FLAG `-DGRAPPLE_VTS=1` and execute with `-n 250`. Result:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of Unique Visited States and thus the state space coverage of both experiments is highly similar: Both experiments have a state space coverage of about 0.45%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of Total Visited States is also highly similar: Both experiments visit about 63568000 states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution time of the second experiment is more than 35x as fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, supposedly only one VT is executed per *grid*, resulting in one CUDA kernel per VT.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion, Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment has shown that the execution of multiple VTs inside a single CUDA kernel highly increases the execution time at nearly equal results. Resulting from this, VTs should be executed in batches whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our hypothesis is confirmed."
