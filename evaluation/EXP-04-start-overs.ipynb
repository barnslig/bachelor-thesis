    "# Protocol: Improving State Space Coverage using Start Overs\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 17.09.2021\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Do *Start Overs* increase the State Space Coverage Growth and thus the model checking performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic BFS search terminates as soon as all successors are already visited according to the hash table. Thus, the maximum BFS depth is determined by the hash table's capacity. Also, each VT again starts at the initial state, resulting in all VTs potentially only exploring the tip of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By continuing the BFS within a VT using the set of last unvisited successors, we can reach deeper states of the model. By exploring deeper states, we expect to discover more violations and thus a faster growing state space coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n",
    "- Program: `main` branch, commit e160572\n",
    "- Model: Waypoints model\n",
    "- CUDA_FLAGS: `-DGRAPPLE_MODEL=WaypointsState`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we compile with the additional CUDA_FLAGS `-DGRAPPLE_HT=18 -DGRAPPLE_SO=0` (the default parameters).\n",
