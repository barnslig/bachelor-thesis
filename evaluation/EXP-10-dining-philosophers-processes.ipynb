    "# Protocol: Comparison of Exploration of the Dining Philosophers Problem with Different Number of Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 17.09.2021\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the number of processes, and by that the state space size, affect the state space exploration performance on the Dining Philosophers Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper suggests that when the state space size of a model surpasses the hash table capacity, state space exploration slows down significantly, resulting in a much higher number of VTs needed to explore >99% of the state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we expect the exploration to slow down starting with Phils-12 on a $2^{18}$ hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n",
    "- Program: `main` branch, commit e160572\n",
    "- Model: Philosophers model\n",
    "- CUDA_FLAGS: `-DGRAPPLE_MODEL=PhilosophersStateV2`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To control the number of processes, we have to alter the constants `kProcesses` and `kStateSpaceSize` in `src/models/PhilosophersStateV2.cuh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we set `kProcesses = 11` and `kStateSpaceSize = 177146`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We stop the experiment after 10 runs as exhaustive state space coverage is already achieved after the first run.\n",

    "| Model | Hash Table Utilization | # of VTs to explore |\n",
    "|-------|------------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| DP-11 | ~68% | 100% in 250 |\n",
    "| DP-12 | ~203% | 100% in 250 |\n",
    "| DP-13 | ~608% | 100% in 53250 |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion, Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The state space size of DP-13 is 9x the state space size of DP-11. However, exploring about 100% of DP-13's state space takes 213x as many VTs as for DP-11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our hypothesis is confirmed on the dining philosophers model."
